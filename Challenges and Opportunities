While the Democracy Game is an exciting concept, itâ€™s not without challenges. Decentralized governance often grapples with issues like:Sybil Attacks: Bad actors could create multiple accounts to manipulate voting outcomes.
Engagement Gaps: Not all users may participate equally, leading to skewed representation.
Complexity: Designing rules that are both fair and easy to understand is a delicate balance.

However, these challenges also present opportunities for innovation. The Democracy Game could test solutions like quadratic voting, reputation-based systems, or cryptographic verification to ensure fairness and transparency.
